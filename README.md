### HTML Files

- **products.html**: This file will list all products available for purchase. It will display information such as product names, descriptions, prices, and "Add to Cart" buttons.
- **cart.html**: This file will show the contents of the user's shopping cart, including the items, quantities, and total cost. It will also have options to update quantities, remove items, and place the order.
- **confirmation.html**: This file will display a confirmation message after the order is placed successfully. It will include the order details and any necessary tracking information.

### Routes

- **@app.route('/')**: This route will render the **products.html** file, showcasing the available products. Here, users can browse products and add them to their cart.
- **@app.route('/cart')**: This route will render the **cart.html** file, displaying the items in the user's shopping cart. Users can update quantities, remove items, and proceed to checkout.
- **@app.route('/checkout')**: This route will handle the checkout process. It will trigger a payment gateway integration or any necessary payment processing. Upon successful payment, this route will redirect to the **confirmation.html** file.
- **@app.route('/confirmation')**: This route will render the **confirmation.html** file, displaying the order confirmation and relevant details for the user's reference.
